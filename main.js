Main flow of the progam

# Content Scraping
    Scrape content from the web (ex. Reddit) to post on the theme page
    Save the scraped content to a file that the script can use to post that content
    Post the saved content to Instagram X times a day

# Growth Hacking
    Common way to gain followers is the follow - unfollow technique 
    The script needs to read a list of account simular to our themepage 
    Grab a list of people to follow based on the people that liked a simular page's posts
    Follow X amount of people per hour and try to stay under Instagram's limits
    Save the followed people to a new list and delete them from the to follow list
    start unfollowing people after x amount of time

    Considerations
        Don't follow people that already follow our page
